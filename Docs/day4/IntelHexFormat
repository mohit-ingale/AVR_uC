Intel Hex Format

This page describes the format of an Intel hex file produced by a suitable assembler. This code is often downloaded from a PC to a development system and run from RAM. Alternatively, the hex file can be converted to a binary file and programmed into an EPROM.

Here is an example hex file:

:10008000AF5F67F0602703E0322CFA92007780C361
:1000900089001C6B7EA7CA9200FE10D2AA00477D81
:0B00A00080FA92006F3600C3A00076CB
:00000001FF

Now look at the top line...

    * The first character (:) indicates the start of a record.
    * The next two characters indicate the record length (10h in this case).
    * The next four characters give the load address (0080h in this case).
    * The next two characters indicate the record type (see below).
    * Then we have the actual data.
    * The last two characters are a checksum (sum of all bytes + checksum = 00). 

The last line of the file is special, and will always look like that above.

Record types:

    * 00 - Data record
    * 01 - End of file record
    * 02 - Extended segment address record
    * 03 - Start segment address record
    * 04 - Extended linear address record
    * 05 - Start linear address record
